# Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests

## 🔍 Task 5 

This project demonstrates the use of tree-based models — Decision Tree and Random Forest — for classification on a heart disease dataset. It covers model training, overfitting analysis, feature importance evaluation, and cross-validation.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which includes health-related features like:

- `age`, `sex`, `cp` (chest pain type), `chol` (cholesterol), etc.
- `target`: 1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Train and visualize a Decision Tree Classifier
- Analyze overfitting by tuning `max_depth`
- Train a Random Forest and compare it with Decision Tree
- Interpret feature importances from the models
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz (optional for advanced tree visualization)
